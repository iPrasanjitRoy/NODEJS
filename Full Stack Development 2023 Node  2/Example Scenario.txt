Example Scenario: 

ðŸ‘‰ Suppose The Request URL Is /product/123. Here, Id Will Be '123' Initially.

ðŸ‘‰ (+id) Converts '123' (A String) To 123 (A Number).

ðŸ‘‰ The .find() Method Searches Through The Products Array To Find An Object Where P.id === 123.

ðŸ‘‰ If A Product With Id 123 Exists In The Products Array, That Product Object Is Assigned To Product.
If No Such Product Exists, Product Will Be Undefined. 



ðŸ‘‰ slideIndex - 1 Is Used To Access The Correct Slide Within The Slides Collection:

ðŸ‘‰ When Slideindex Is 1, Slides[slideindex - 1] Accesses The First Element In Slides (At Index 0).
ðŸ‘‰ When Slideindex Is 2, Slides[slideindex - 1] Accesses The Second Element In Slides (At Index 1), And So On.
